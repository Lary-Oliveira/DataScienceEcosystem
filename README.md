# Data Science Tools and Ecosystem

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`DataScienceEcosystem.ipynb`) that provides an overview of key tools and technologies used in Data Science.

## What's Inside

The notebook covers:

*   Popular programming languages for Data Science
*   Commonly used Data Science libraries
*   Essential Data Science tools
*   Examples of arithmetic expressions in Python
*   Unit conversion (minutes to hours)

## Notebook Structure

The notebook is divided into Markdown cells (for explanations) and code cells (for execution).

## ðŸ“Œ Key Exercises

The notebook includes exercises demonstrating:

1.  Creating a Jupyter Notebook
2.  Adding Markdown cells for documentation
3.  Listing languages and libraries used in Data Science
4.  Creating a table of Data Science tools
5.  Writing and evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python
6.  Converting time units using Python

## Running the Notebook

To run the notebook locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone this repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Lary-Oliveira/DataScienceEcosystem.git](https://github.com/Lary-Oliveira/DataScienceEcosystem.git)
